### 🧩 ABOUT CREALIVITY

**Crealivity** is a small, independent software initiative focused on building creating non-commercial, public-source projects, tools, apps, and experiments built for real-world use and curiosity.

We explore everything from Android tooling and system-level utilities to web frameworks and automation scripts. Every project is born from real-world problems, and often late-night ideas that actually worked.

While not open-source in the strict legal sense, our work is **transparent**, **freely available for personal use**, and built with the same open, collaborative spirit that drives the wider developer community.

* 🌍 Based somewhere in the middle of nowhere 🌌  
* 🧠 Rooted in open-source, tinkering, and learning
* 🖥️ See our work at [crealivity.eu](https://crealivity.eu)
* ✉️ Contact: [contact@crealivity.eu](mailto:contact@crealivity.eu)
